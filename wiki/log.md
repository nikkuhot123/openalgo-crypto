# Chronological Log

An append-only record of wiki updates, backtests, and VPS operations.

---

## [2026-08-07] operations | retired two strategies
- Stopped `openalgo` service and removed two registrations from `strategy_configs.json` (11 -> 9 remaining).
- **Red Bar X-Candle**: Retired. Walk-forward thin edge (1.20) collapsed on unfitted window (1.05); live trade today lost Rs 1,777 at EOD.
- **Overnight Drift**: Retired. Sizing model requires Rs 52 Lakhs for 1 lot at 0.36 exposure; live balance cannot support it.

## [2026-08-07] operations | contained 16G runaway service log
- Found `/opt/openalgo/log/openalgo.log` at 16 GB, filling `/` to 86%.
- Cause: systemd unit redirecting stdout/stderr with no logrotate in place.
- Action: archived tail, truncated file (freeing 16G, disk -> 51%), and installed `openalgo-logcap` hourly systemd timer for size-gated copytruncate.
- Tested: confirmed truncate works on test file.

## [2026-08-07] research | Renko PRO backtest
- Ported `Doctor_Diven_Smart_Renko_Engine_Pro_Combined.pine` to Python.
- Backtested NIFTY 5m/15m/30m 2023-2026. Positive in index points (+4.1 at 30m) but loses on option friction.
- Finding: 51% of profits came from 5 trades. Cross-symbol tests (BANKNIFTY, FINNIFTY) failed. Edge is noise.

## [2026-08-07] research | Judas strike selection
- Replayed 4 live Judas trades across 7 strikes (OTM3 to ITM3).
- Finding: ITM decreases theta% bleed but scales up friction Rs due to premium size. ATM is worst, but no strike rescues the leak. Exit is the lever.

## [2026-08-07] bugfix | PDH/PDL quote crash
- Fixed two dead calls in `prior_levels_ema_strategy.py` (`client.quote` and `client.orderhistory`) that blocked all live entries.
- Fixed pre-market 09:10 crash loop by adding retry wait loop for exchange master.
- Added AST check `test_strategy_sdk_surface.py` to prevent future dead calls.

## [2026-08-07] instrumentation | Judas & POV premium paths
- Added throttled `PATH` logging (default 30s) to Judas and POV.
- Pre-registered gate for Judas exit change: wait for n>=15 trades before acting.
